    "section": "",
    "text": "I have often argued that there are several reasons why the U.S. makes a better comparator for Canada than other advanced economies. As a country that often leads other nations in economic performance measures like GDP and productivity growth, advancements in innovation and technology, and competitive intensity, the U.S. represents the frontier of economic performance. That frontier represents the potential that other countries could achieve but fail to reach. Consequently, the U.S. has been the default country of choice for benchmarking global economic performance for many countries, none more so than Canada.\nBut with every standard approach to measuring economic activity, there is always an exception. A striking example of this comes from a report published by Cable.co.uk called The Cost of 1GB of Mobile Data in 237 Countries, 2023. It compares median prices for mobile data plans globally from 2019 to 2023. When I compared prices for Canada to those of other G7 countries and a few others of interest for a broader comparison group, it was clear that the U.S. is the country that is least suitable as a benchmark for success. In a country vaunted for its entrepreneurial spirit, weakening price competition among major U.S. telecoms has deteriorated from a poor ranking of 151 out of 237 countries in 2019 at $8.34 per GB to 219th overall at $6.00 per GB in 2023.\nIn The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets, economist Thomas Philippon examines the decline in competitiveness within the U.S. telecom industry. He attributes this trend to the combination of market consolidation, weakened antitrust enforcement, and increased corporate use of lobbying to influence policy has led to a less competitive environment in the U.S. telecom industry, adversely affecting consumers through higher prices and reduced service quality.\nA look at how other countries have driven down mobile data costs over time suggests that Canada can learn more from countries that persistently define the frontier of success when it comes to a competitive telecom sector.\nThe 2023 global ranking of mobile data prices shows a clear divide between the most competitive markets—where data costs are consistently low—and countries like Canada, where prices remain stubbornly high despite overall global declines. While the price of mobile data has dropped worldwide over the last five years, Canada remains an outlier.\nIn 2023, Canada ranked 216th out of 237 countries, with an average price of $5.37 per GB. While this is an improvement from 2019, when the price was $13.21 per GB, it is still among the highest costs in the developed world. The only G7 country with higher prices was the United States. However, this does not make Canada’s pricing more competitive—it merely highlights that both countries are outliers compared to global trends.\nMeanwhile, the lowest-cost countries—Italy ($0.09 per GB), France ($0.20), and Israel ($0.02 in 2023)—have sustained extremely low prices while maintaining world-class telecom infrastructure. Other geographically large nations such as Australia ($0.44 per GB) and Finland ($0.52 per GB) also manage to offer mobile data at a fraction of Canada’s cost.\nCanadian telecom companies often justify high prices by pointing to the U.S. as a benchmark. They argue that vast geography, low population density, and high infrastructure costs make it difficult to lower prices. Yet, if these were the primary determinants of pricing, we would expect similar trends in other large, sparsely populated, high-income countries. Instead, the data tells a different story.\nOne of the main problems with using the U.S. as a comparison is that it is not a model of telecom competition. The American mobile market is dominated by three major providers—Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile—with limited price competition. Using the U.S. as a benchmark only reinforces a high-cost, low-competition model rather than one that fosters affordability.\nOther geographically large nations have managed to keep prices low while maintaining strong network infrastructure. Australia, for example, ranked 39th in 2023 with an average price of $0.44 per GB—over 12 times cheaper than in Canada. Finland, with its cold climate and relatively small market, offers mobile data at $0.52 per GB. These countries demonstrate that network infrastructure costs alone do not dictate pricing. Instead, they have implemented competitive policies that encourage multiple low-cost providers and prevent telecom monopolies from setting artificially high prices.\nOne of the biggest differences between Canada and the most competitive mobile markets is regulatory policy. Countries such as France and Italy have aggressively enforced competition by allowing multiple low-cost providers to operate, requiring infrastructure sharing, and preventing major telecom companies from controlling the market. In contrast, Canada’s telecom sector remains highly concentrated, with Bell, Rogers, and Telus controlling the vast majority of mobile services in a highly fragmented regional market.\nIf Canada wants to reduce mobile data prices, it should take lessons from countries that have moved closer to the frontier of competitiveness by successfully creating competitive markets. France and Italy have managed to drive prices down to some of the lowest levels in the world while maintaining high-quality networks.\nThe Italian mobile telecommunications market is characterized by intense price competition, which has significantly eroded operators’ profit margins. This competitive environment has been intensified by the entry of new players, such as the French telecom group Iliad in 2018, which disrupted the market with aggressive pricing strategies. The presence of multiple operators striving for market share has driven prices down, benefiting consumers according to FitchRatings.\nSimilarly, France’s mobile data market is highly competitive, with four major operators sharing the consumer base. This intense competition has led to some of the lowest prices in Europe and demonstrating that there is more to inducing competition than the number of operators. The French regulatory framework, expanded in the early 2010s to accommodate new fiber optic networks, was designed to maintain and encourage competitive dynamics. As a result, the free entry and exit of competitors can be as important as the number of competitors. As such, France’s Ministry of the Economy and Finance contends that the low prices are primarily a result of market forces, with operators competitively pricing their services to attract and retain customers, rather than direct government-imposed price controls.\nThat said, no one should believe that Europe has all the answers. Mario Draghi’s recommendation in The Future of European Competitiveness to allow consolidation may achieve better profitability and additional investment for the EU’s 34 mobile network operators (MNOs).1 But if the cost of 1GB of mobile data is any indicator, allowing concentration to reduce the number of MNOs to just three, as in the U.S., may be going too far. While both Italy and France have regulatory bodies that promote fair competition and market entry, the low mobile data prices in these countries are chiefly due to vigorous competition among a sufficient number of operators, rather than government regulations that directly set or cap prices.\nCanada’s high telecom prices are not inevitable. While infrastructure and investment costs play a role, they do not fully explain why Canadians continue to pay more for mobile data than people in countries with similar challenges. The fact that Australia, Finland, and several European nations have dramatically lower prices suggests that Canada’s telecom sector is suffering from a lack of effective competition."

    "section": "Some of haven’s Most Useful Options",
    "text": "Some of haven’s Most Useful Options\nWhen working with data files—especially large ones—you often don’t need every single column or row loaded into your R session. This is where haven’s options like col_select, skip, and n_max become incredibly useful. They give you finer control over the data import process, making your workflow more efficient and your code more purposeful. Let’s break down what each option does and see a few examples in action.\ncol_select The col_select option lets you specify exactly which columns to import from your dataset. This is particularly beneficial when:\nskip Sometimes data files include rows at the beginning that aren’t part of the actual dataset—maybe they contain metadata, comments, or headers that aren’t structured as data. The skip option allows you to tell haven to ignore a specified number of rows at the start of the file.\nn_max When exploring a new dataset or working with very large files, you might only want to import a subset of the data to get a feel for its structure and content. The n_max option sets an upper limit on the number of rows to read.\nBelow is a simple example in R that demonstrates how to use these options when reading a SAS file with haven:\nlibrary(haven)\n\n# Suppose we have a SAS dataset 'data.sas7bdat' and we want to:\n# - Read only the columns: age, income, and gender.\n# - Skip the first 2 rows (perhaps they contain metadata or non-data info).\n# - Limit our import to the first 100 rows for a quick preview.\n\ndata_preview &lt;- read_sas(\"data.sas7bdat\",\n                         col_select = c(age, income, gender),\n                         skip = 2,\n                         n_max = 100)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the resulting data frame\nhead(data_preview)\ncol_select = c(age, income, gender) tells haven to include only those three variables. skip = 2 instructs it to bypass the first two rows. n_max = 100 ensures that only 100 rows are read, which is perfect for an initial data exploration.\nBy using these options:\n\nYou Gain Speed: Loading only necessary parts of your data speeds up your workflow, particularly useful when dealing with large files.\nYou Save Resources: Less memory is consumed, which is ideal when working in environments with limited resources.\nYou Enhance Clarity: Your code explicitly shows which parts of the dataset you need, making it easier for others (and your future self) to understand your workflow."

    "text": "Selected Work\nGu, Wulong, and Michael Willox. (2023). The Post-2001 Productivity Growth Divergence between Canada and the United States. International Productivity Monitor, (45), 28-60.\nAbstract: The high degree of integration between the Canadian and the US economies promotes sharing of technologies and innovation spillovers that are conducive to long-term productivity growth convergence. However, since 2001 labour productivity growth rates have diverged in sharp contrast to the previous four decades. A comparison of labour productivity growth decomposed into contributions by industry for both countries reveals that the information and cultural services industry has played an outsized role in the divergence, the start of which coincides with the dot-com recession of the early 2000s. Limits on foreign investment, most notably but not exclusively related to telecommunications, and strong output price growth relative to the United States are key factors for undertaking a simple counterfactual analysis to evaluate the role of competitive intensity in the information and cultural services industry. Estimates of markups and their impact on labour productivity growth suggest that limited competition has significantly reduced the productivity performance of that industry as well as the performances of others that are dependent on its services as intermediate inputs.\nKumbhakar, Subal C., Oleg Badunenko and Michael Willox. (2022). Do carbon taxes affect economic and environmental efficiency? The case of British Columbia’s manufacturing plants. Energy Economics 115: 106359.

In contrast to most papers that examine environmental policy impacts on either the economy or the environment, our approach combines a by-production model within a stochastic frontier framework to evaluate the tax’s impacts on both economic and environmental efficiency. Our findings suggest that a 1.0% increase in the carbon tax improved manufacturers’ efficiency in producing desirable output (real sales of manufactured goods) by 0.5%. In addition, the same 1.0% increase in the carbon tax improved manufacturers’ environmental efficiency for greenhouse gas (GHGs) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by the same amount, 0.2%. However, the carbon tax led to lower environmental efficiency for emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX), −0.3%. In addition, our use of a rich plant-level dataset reveals considerable heterogeneity in manufacturers’ efficiency responses to the tax. Finally, we suggest that lower efficiency levels for undesirable outputs than desirable outputs indicate that the relative cost of adjusting production processes to improve efficiency favors economic efficiency over environmental efficiency.\nLafrance-Cooke, Amelie, Ryan Macdonald and Michael Willox.

Statistics Canada.\nAbstract: The need to measure both the desirable outputs (goods and services) and the undesirable outputs (emissions of greenhouse gases [GHGs] and criteria air contaminants [CACs]) from economic activity is becoming increasingly important as economic performance and environmental performance become ever more intertwined. Standard measures of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth provide insights into rising standards of living and the performance of economies, but they may be misleading if only desirable outputs are considered. This study presents estimates of environmentally adjusted multifactor productivity (EAMFP) growth using a new comprehensive database. This database contains information on GHG and CAC emissions, as well as on the production activities of Canadian manufacturers. Overall, the results indicate that EAMFP growth was higher than MFP growth, largely reflecting declines in the undesirable output emissions intensity, in the manufacturing sector from 2004 to 2012.\nGu, Wulong, and Michael Willox. (2018). Productivity Growth in Canada and the United States: Recent Industry Trends and Potential Explanations. International Productivity Monitor, (35), 73-94.\nAbstract: Labour productivity growth in Canada was weaker than that in the United States from the mid-1980s to 2010, leading to a decline in Canada’s relative productivity level. This situation was mainly due to the lower multifactor productivity (MFP) growth experienced in most Canadian industries in that period. After 2010, however, the pattern reversed itself as labour productivity growth in Canada exceeded that of the United States. Higher labour productivity growth in Canada for the 2010-2014 period was due to a relatively larger capital deepening eﬀect and relatively higher MFP growth. Both these developments were associated with stronger output growth and stronger demand in Canada. In addition, the contributions of ICT producing and ICT intensive using industries to U.S. labour productivity growth waned after 2010. For Canada, ICT producing industries contributed little to overall labour productivity before and after 2010, while ICT intensive using industries exhibited stronger productivity growth after 2010. The latter may reﬂect the more moderate ICT investment in Canada compared to the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s and the more gradual realization of beneﬁts of ICT usage.\nBaldwin, J. R., and Michael Willox. (2016). The Industry Origins of Canada’s Weaker Labour Productivity Performance and the Role of Structural Adjustment in the Post-2000 Period. International Productivity Monitor, (31), 19-36.\nAbstract: This article examines how much of the slowdown in labour productivity growth observed in Canada’s business sector after 2000 was due to weaker productivity growth within industries and how much was due to structural adjustment. The analysis makes use of a decomposition method that differs from many of the standard decomposition approaches commonly found in the literature and allows for the contributions of changes in the importance of individual industries to be calculated. The approach reveals that the post-2000 slowdown was attributable entirely to weaker productivity growth within industries and that structural adjustment had a slight mitigating effect on the slowdown. Lower productivity growth within three industries - manufacturing; finance, insurance and real estate; and mining, oil and gas - accounted for all of the slowdown in business sector labour productivity growth in the 2000s."

    "text": "The United States as an Economic Benchmark—But Not for Telecom\nI have often argued that there are several reasons why the U.S. makes a better comparator for Canada than other advanced economies. As a country that often leads other nations in measures of economic performance, like GDP and productivity growth, advancements in innovation and technology, and competitive intensity, the U.S. in many ways defines the frontier of economic performance. That frontier represents the potential that similarly advanced economies could achieve but fail to reach. Consequently, the U.S. has been the default country of choice for benchmarking global economic performance for many countries, none more so than Canada.\nHowever, there are always exceptions. A striking example comes from a report published by Cable.co.uk called [The Cost of 1GB of Mobile Data in 237 Countries, 2023, https://bestbroadbanddeals.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/]. It compares median prices for mobile data plans globally from 2019 to 2023. Out of curiosity, I spent an evening comparing prices for Canada to those of other G7 countries and a few others of interest for a broader comparison group. What I found made it clear that the U.S. is the least suitable as a benchmark for success. In a country vaunted for its entrepreneurial spirit, weakening price competition among major U.S. telecoms has deteriorated from a poor ranking of 151 ($8.34 per GB) out of 237 countries in 2019 to a dismal 219th ($6.00 per GB) overall in 2023."

    "text": "The High Cost of Mobile Data in Canada\nThe 2023 global ranking of mobile data prices shows a clear divide between the most competitive markets—where data costs are consistently low—and countries like Canada, where prices remain stubbornly high despite overall global declines. While the price of mobile data has dropped worldwide over the last five years, Canada remains an outlier.\nIn 2023, Canada ranked 216th out of 237 countries, with an average price of $5.37 per GB. While this is an improvement from 2019, when the price was $13.21 per GB, it is still among the highest costs in the developed world. The only G7 country with higher prices was the U.S. However, this does not make Canada’s pricing more competitive—it merely highlights that both countries are outliers compared to global trends.\nMeanwhile, the lowest-cost countries—Italy ($0.09 per GB), France ($0.20 per GB), and Israel ($0.02 per GB)—have sustained extremely low prices while maintaining world-class telecom infrastructure. Other geographically large nations, such as Australia ($0.44 per GB) and Finland, with a cold climate and a relatively small market ($0.52 per GB), also manage to offer mobile data at a fraction of Canada’s cost."

    "text": "Why the United States is a Poor Comparator for Canada’s Telecom Market\nCanadian telecom companies often justify high prices by pointing to the U.S. as a benchmark and argue that vast geography, low population density, and high infrastructure costs make it difficult to lower prices. Yet, if these were the primary determinants of pricing, we would expect similar trends in other large, sparsely populated, high-income countries. Instead, the data tells a different story.1 2\nOne of the main problems with using the U.S. as a comparison is that it is not a model of telecom competition. The American mobile market is dominated by three major providers—Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile—with limited price competition. Using the U.S. as a benchmark only reinforces a high-cost, low-competition model rather than one that fosters affordability.\nIn The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets, economist Thomas Philippon examines the decline in competitiveness within the U.S. telecom industry. He attributes this trend to the combination of market consolidation, weakened antitrust enforcement, and increased corporate lobbying, which have led to a less competitive environment. As a result, consumers face higher prices and reduced service quality."

    "section": "How Other Countries Keep Mobile Data Costs Low",
    "text": "How Other Countries Keep Mobile Data Costs Low\nA look at how other countries have driven down mobile data costs over time suggests that Canada can learn more from countries that persistently define the frontier of success when it comes to a competitive telecom sector.\nOther geographically large nations have managed to keep prices low while maintaining strong network infrastructure. Australia, for example, ranked 39th in 2023 with an average price of $0.44 per GB—over 12 times cheaper than in Canada. Finland ranked 48th in 2023, offering mobile data at $0.52 per GB. These countries demonstrate that network infrastructure costs alone do not dictate pricing. Instead, they have reduced barriers to entry, encouraged multiple low-cost providers and prevented telecom monopolies from setting artificially high prices.\nCountries, such as France and Italy, have aggressively enforced competition by allowing multiple low-cost providers to operate, requiring infrastructure sharing, and preventing major telecom companies from controlling the market. In contrast, Canada’s telecom sector remains highly concentrated, with Bell, Rogers, and Telus controlling the vast majority of mobile services. While Italy and France each have only one more nationwide telecom provider, a significant complementary factor appears to be low barriers to entry for new competitors.\nThe Italian mobile telecom market, for example, is characterized by intense price competition, which has significantly eroded operators’ profit margins. This competitive environment has been intensified by the entry of new players, such as the French telecom group Iliad in 2018, which disrupted the market with aggressive pricing strategies. The presence of multiple operators striving for market share has driven prices down, benefiting consumers. 3 Similarly, France’s mobile data market is highly competitive, with four major operators sharing the consumer base. This has led to some of the lowest prices in Europe."

    "text": "What Canada Can Learn from More Competitive Telecom Markets\nIf Canada wants to reduce mobile data prices, it should take lessons from countries that have successfully created competitive markets. France and Italy have managed to drive prices down to some of the lowest levels in the world while maintaining high-quality networks. Their regulatory bodies promote fair competition and market entry, ensuring that competition remains strong without resorting to government-imposed price controls.\nThat said, no one should believe that Europe has all the answers. Mario Draghi’s recommendation in The Future of European Competitiveness to allow consolidation may achieve better profitability and additional investment for the EU’s 34 mobile network operators (MNOs).4 Countries with smaller populations, like Finland, Sweden and Norway, that have struggled to remain competitive, may benefit the most from the increase in integration and scale that concentration provides. However, if the cost of 1GB of mobile data is any indicator, allowing concentration to reduce the number of MNOs to just three, as in the U.S. and Canada, may be going too far. While both Italy and France have regulatory frameworks that promote competition, their low mobile data prices are primarily a result of market forces, with low barriers to entry and a sufficient number of operators competitively pricing their services to attract and retain customers.\nCanada’s high telecom prices are not inevitable. While infrastructure and investment costs play a role, they do not fully explain why Canadians continue to pay more for mobile data than people in countries with similar challenges. The fact that Australia, Finland, and several European nations have dramatically lower prices suggests that Canada’s telecom sector is suffering from a lack of effective competition.\nNote: These are my personal views and opinions and do not reflect those of my employer or any affiliated organizations.
