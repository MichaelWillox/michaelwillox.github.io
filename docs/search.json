Maybe you’ve heard it’s complicated or you’ve already had a frustrating experience. Well, you’re in the right place—let’s make this easy and fun!\nFirst things first, let’s get familiar with RStudio, the tool we’ll use to work with R. Below, you’ll see a screenshot of RStudio. It might look a little overwhelming at first, but don’t worry! The important part for us is the script window, which is where you’ll write your R code. To open a new script, just click on File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. You can write your code there and save it by clicking File &gt; Save or pressing Ctrl + S. Easy peasy!\n\n\n\nRStudio Screenshot\n\n\nNow, let’s get down to business—transforming file formats! 🕺"

Maybe it’s in a weird format your boss likes or something a client sent over that makes your eyes cross. Fortunately, R has a handy package called haven that makes reading and saving different file formats a breeze. Whether it’s a Stata .dta file, SPSS .sav file, or SAS .sas7bdat file, we’ve got you covered!"

To install the package, you just need to type this line of code in your script and run it:\ninstall.packages(\"haven\")\nOnce the package is installed, we need to load it into our R session using the library() function. Think of this like opening the app after you’ve downloaded it:\nlibrary(haven)"
