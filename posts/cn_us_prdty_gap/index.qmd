## Multifactor Productivity Growth Estimates and Industry Pproductivity Database

Statistics Canada release national estimates for multifactor productivity (MFP) today with data from 1961 to 2023. You can find a write up about the updated Tables [36-10-0208-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610020801) and [36-10-0217-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610021701) in [The Daily](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/dai-quo/index-eng.htm?HPA=1).

To mark the occasion, I updated a chart from an earlier post comparing Canadian and U.S. business sector labour productivity growth.

The graph is related to a paper I wrote with my colleague, Wulong Gu, called [*The Post-2001 Productivity Growth Divergence between Canada and the United States*](https://csls.ca/ipm/ipm45.asp). In that paper, we argue that the high degree of integration between the Canadian and the U.S. economies promotes sharing of technologies and innovation spillovers that are conducive to long-term labour productivity growth convergence. That what we observe from observed from 1961 to around 2000. However, our findings suggest that those economic forces were muted due to declining competitive intensity in Canada after 2001.
