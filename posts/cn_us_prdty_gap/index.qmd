## Multifactor Productivity Growth Estimates and Industry Productivity Database

Statistics Canada released national estimates for multifactor productivity (MFP) today with data from 1961 to 2023. You can find a write-up about the updated Tables [36-10-0208-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610020801) and [36-10-0217-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610021701) in [The Daily](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/dai-quo/index-eng.htm?HPA=1).

To mark the occasion, I updated a chart from an earlier post comparing Canadian and U.S. business sector labour productivity growth.

The graph is related to a paper I wrote with my colleague, Wulong Gu, titled [*The Post-2001 Productivity Growth Divergence between Canada and the United States*](https://csls.ca/ipm/ipm45.asp). 

You can access the R code to recreate the graph [here](https://github.com/MichaelWillox/michaelwillox.github.io/tree/main/posts/cn_us_prdty_gap).
