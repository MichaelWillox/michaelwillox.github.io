I have often argued that there are several reasons why the U.S. makes a better comparator for Canada than other advanced economies. As a country that often leads other nations in economic performance measures like GDP and productivity growth, advancements in innovation and technology, and competitive intensity, the U.S. represents the frontier of economic performance. That frontier represents the potential that other countries could achieve but fail to reach. Consequently, the U.S. has been the default country of choice for benchmarking global economic performance for many countries, none more so than Canada.

But with every standard approach to measuring economic activity, there is always an exception. A striking example of this comes from a report published by Cable.co.uk called [The Cost of 1GB of Mobile Data in 237 Countries, 2023](https://bestbroadbanddeals.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/). It compares median prices for mobile data plans globally from 2019 to 2023. When I compared prices for Canada to those of other G7 countries and a few others of interest for a broader comparison group, it was clear that the U.S. is the country that is least suitable as a benchmark for success. In a country vaunted for its entrepreneurial spirit, weakening price competition among major U.S. telecoms has deteriorated from a poor ranking of 151 out of 237 countries in 2019 at \$8.34 per GB to 219^th^ overall at \$6.00 per GB in 2023.

In *The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets*, economist Thomas Philippon examines the decline in competitiveness within the U.S. telecom industry. He attributes this trend to the combination of market consolidation, weakened antitrust enforcement, and increased corporate use of lobbying to influence policy has led to a less competitive environment in the U.S. telecom industry, adversely affecting consumers through higher prices and reduced service quality.

A look at how other countries have driven down mobile data costs over time suggests that Canada can learn more from countries that persistently define the frontier of success when it comes to a competitive telecom sector.

The 2023 global ranking of mobile data prices shows a clear divide between the most competitive markets—where data costs are consistently low—and countries like Canada, where prices remain stubbornly high despite overall global declines. While the price of mobile data has dropped worldwide over the last five years, Canada remains an outlier.

In 2023, Canada ranked 216^th^ out of 237 countries, with an average price of \$5.37 per GB. While this is an improvement from 2019, when the price was \$13.21 per GB, it is still among the highest costs in the developed world. The only G7 country with higher prices was the United States. However, this does not make Canada’s pricing more competitive—it merely highlights that both countries are outliers compared to global trends.

Meanwhile, the lowest-cost countries—Italy (\$0.09 per GB), France (\$0.20), and Israel (\$0.02 in 2023)—have sustained extremely low prices while maintaining world-class telecom infrastructure. Other geographically large nations such as Australia (\$0.44 per GB) and Finland (\$0.52 per GB) also manage to offer mobile data at a fraction of Canada’s cost.

Canadian telecom companies often justify high prices by pointing to the U.S. as a benchmark. They argue that vast geography, low population density, and high infrastructure costs make it difficult to lower prices. Yet, if these were the primary determinants of pricing, we would expect similar trends in other large, sparsely populated, high-income countries. Instead, the data tells a different story.

One of the main problems with using the U.S. as a comparison is that it is not a model of telecom competition. The American mobile market is dominated by three major providers—Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile—with limited price competition. Using the U.S. as a benchmark only reinforces a high-cost, low-competition model rather than one that fosters affordability.

Other geographically large nations have managed to keep prices low while maintaining strong network infrastructure. Australia, for example, ranked 39th in 2023 with an average price of \$0.44 per GB—over 12 times cheaper than in Canada. Finland, with its cold climate and relatively small market, offers mobile data at \$0.52 per GB. These countries demonstrate that network infrastructure costs alone do not dictate pricing. Instead, they have implemented competitive policies that encourage multiple low-cost providers and prevent telecom monopolies from setting artificially high prices.

One of the biggest differences between Canada and the most competitive mobile markets is regulatory policy. Countries such as France and Italy have aggressively enforced competition by allowing multiple low-cost providers to operate, requiring infrastructure sharing, and preventing major telecom companies from controlling the market. In contrast, Canada’s telecom sector remains highly concentrated, with Bell, Rogers, and Telus controlling the vast majority of mobile services in a highly fragmented regional market.

If Canada wants to reduce mobile data prices, it should take lessons from countries that have moved closer to the frontier of competitiveness by successfully creating competitive markets. France and Italy have managed to drive prices down to some of the lowest levels in the world while maintaining high-quality networks.

The Italian mobile telecommunications market is characterized by intense price competition, which has significantly eroded operators' profit margins. This competitive environment has been intensified by the entry of new players, such as the French telecom group Iliad in 2018, which disrupted the market with aggressive pricing strategies. The presence of multiple operators striving for market share has driven prices down, benefiting consumers according to [FitchRatings](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/iliad-entry-intensifies-competition-in-italian-mobile-08-08-2018).

Similarly, France's mobile data market is highly competitive, with four major operators sharing the consumer base. This intense competition has led to some of the lowest prices in Europe and demonstrating that there is more to inducing competition than the number of operators. The French regulatory framework, expanded in the early 2010s to accommodate new fiber optic networks, was designed to maintain and encourage competitive dynamics. As a result, the free entry and exit of competitors can be as important as the number of competitors. As such, [France’s Ministry of the Economy and Finance](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/Articles/e7473e7a-5abc-4fc8-899c-1621d9b72d1d/files/29a63c9c-4e41-455a-ba41-942d2b096156) contends that the low prices are primarily a result of market forces, with operators competitively pricing their services to attract and retain customers, rather than direct government-imposed price controls.

That said, no one should believe that Europe has all the answers. Mario Draghi's recommendation in [The Future of European Competitiveness](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/draghi-report_en) to allow consolidation may achieve better profitability and additional investment for the EU's 34 mobile network operators (MNOs).[^1] But if the cost of 1GB of mobile data is any indicator, allowing concentration to reduce the number of MNOs to just three, as in the U.S., may be going too far. While both Italy and France have regulatory bodies that promote fair competition and market entry, the low mobile data prices in these countries are chiefly due to vigorous competition among a sufficient number of operators, rather than government regulations that directly set or cap prices.

[^1]: MNOs own and operate their own infrastructure. Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) do not own the infrastructure and must purchase wholesale access to the networks of MNOs for resale to end consumers under their own brand.

Canada’s high telecom prices are not inevitable. While infrastructure and investment costs play a role, they do not fully explain why Canadians continue to pay more for mobile data than people in countries with similar challenges. The fact that Australia, Finland, and several European nations have dramatically lower prices suggests that Canada’s telecom sector is suffering from a lack of effective competition.
